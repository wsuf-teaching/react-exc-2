# React exercise 2

This is the second exercise in the series. It is about styling elements in React.

The description of the subtasks can be found also in App.js as comments:

- Apply the regular CSS class "mainheading" defined in index.css on the h1 in the App.js.

- Use inline styles to make the h3 present have a red border, blue colour and yellow background.

- Create a styled component called "Card" (which is a div) that wraps the h2 in App.js 
You can put the h2 between its opening and closing tags and it will be displayed.
(Styled components are already installed, you just have to use them.)
Eexample properties you can use:
    - border: 2px solid black;
    - display: block; 
    - margin: auto; 
    - padding: 5px; 
    - width: 500px;

- Make the Card have 2px dashed red border when hovering over it.

- Extend the li inside the map ul construct with a conditional (inline) style that sets every second element's background colour to red, and the rest to blue.

- Import the App.module.css properly, and apply the CSS module classes on the footer and its children appropriately.
(footer on the footer, footer-section on the divs, footer-title on the h4s, footer-list on the uls)
Remember, that these are CSS module classes, they are used differently than regular classes.
